    Change string to a new character set :
        Given a 26 letter character set, which is equivalent to character set of English alphabet 
        i.e. (abcd….xyz) and act as a relation. We are also given several sentences and we have to 
        translate them with the help of given new character set.

002 :
    Sorting array of strings (or words) using Trie :
        Given an array of strings, print them in alphabetical (dictionary) order. If there are 
        duplicates in input array, we need to print them only once.

    Left Rotation and Right Rotation of a String
        Given a string of size n, write functions to perform the following operations on a string-
        :: Left (Or anticlockwise) rotate the given string by d elements (where d <= n)
        :: Right (Or clockwise) rotate the given string by d elements (where d <= n).

    Minimum rotations required to get the same string
        Given a string, we need to find the minimum number of rotations required to get the same string.

    Check if given strings are rotations of each other or not
        Given a string s1 and a string s2, write a function to check whether s2 is a rotation of s1.

    Perfect reversible string
        You are given a string ‘str’, the task is to check that reverses of all possible 
        substrings of ‘str’ are present in ‘str’ or not.
